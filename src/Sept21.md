## OpenSource Problems

Users, Developers/Managers, Security Staff

## for Users

to communicate needs and priorities

---

## for Developers and Managers

to identify highest-value fixes

---

## for Security Professionals

to get advanced warning of vulnerabilities

---

## A New Approach

Unlike __bug bounty systems__ : tradable contracts at market price

Unlike __kickstarter campaigns__ : fine-grained contracts attached to GitHub issues

Unlike __social signals__ : a positive outlet for priorities and develoer support

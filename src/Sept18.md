## A New Approach

Unlike __bug bounty systems__ : tradable contracts that reach a market
price

Unlike __kickstarter campaigns__ : fine-grained contracts attached to
individual GitHub issues

Unlike __social signals__ (like public compaints) : a positive outlet for
express priorities and support developers

---

## Two Types of Futures Contracts

__Reward Contracts__ for fixes

__Forecast Contract__ for information
